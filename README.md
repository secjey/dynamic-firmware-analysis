## Description

This project is based on the idea of Gupta who developed a simple python
[script](https://github.com/attify/firmware-analysis-toolkit) to automate the emulation process with the Firmadyne scripts. However, this project goes one step further: Thanks to the use of the pexpect python module, the python script not only automates the Firmadyne system but also efficiently
interacts with processes started by the Firmadyne scripts and handles a range of
issues dynamically.
